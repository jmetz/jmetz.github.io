# Introduction 


# Numpy 

We be using Numpy like

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
np.zeros((10,10))
{% endhighlight %}

# Matplotlib

Now that we have started to see how to work with data arrays (1d+!), it's useful 
to also be able to visualize these data both in order to understand what's "going on" 
as well as for final presentation. 

Matplotlib, while historically less powerful and professional looking that e.g. the 
R plotting library `ggplot`, has closed the gap in recent years with more modern styles 
having been added, as well as recent work on additional "backends" to improve 
performance. 



# Scipy

Technically, we have already been learning about Scipy, as Numpy and Matplotlib are both 
considered to be within the Scipy stack. 
However, in addition to two of the major components of this stack (Numpy and Matplotlib), 
Scipy also offers a Scipy library which contains additional useful sub-modules. 




# Optional sections

You have now finished starting to learn about some of the core scientific 
analysis and visualization modules in Python. 

There are however many many more libraries out there. 
You are welcome to select as many of the following sections as interest you. 


## [OPTIONAL] R-like data analysis with Pandas

## [OPTIONAL] Image Processing with Scikit-Image and Scipy ndimage

## [OPTIONAL] Object Oriented Programming

## [OPTIONAL] Classical Graphical User Interfaces with PyQt

## [OPTIONAL] Web applications with Flask
